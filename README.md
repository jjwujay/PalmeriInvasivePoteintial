# Invasive potential in a malignant weed
A novel metric based on GEAs, which we term invasive potential, to assess invasive trend
See details:
# Date for GF model of 10 SNPs datasets
- CMX_snp_env_all_ran[1-3].csv: Three subsets of ALl SNPs and 19 environmental variables under pressent climate
- CMX_snp_env_climate_ran[1-3].csv: Three subsets of SNPs associated with environmental variables and 19 environmental variables under pressent climate
- CMX_snp_env_select_ran[1-3].csv: Three subsets of SNPs located in selective regions and 19 environmental variables under pressent climate
# Data for calculate Invasive Potential
- CMX_snp_env.csv: minor allele frequency of 1525 SNPs and 19 environmental variables under pressent climate
- CMX_current_invasive_ranges_random_points.csv: random points with 19 environmental variables under pressent climate in the current invasive range
- CMX_study_areas_future_climatexxx_random_points.csv: random points with 19 environmental variables under different future climate in the study areas
